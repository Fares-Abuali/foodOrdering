# Food Ordering & Delivery Management System

I built this project as a requirement for "Software Engineering" (3rd Year university curriculum). 

## Biref Description:
This was an implementation for a fully functional website using PHP and MySQL database that allows restaurant owner to:
- create e-menu
- insert food items
- classify them in categories.
- Clients can browse the menu, search for specific dishes
- then place an order.
- Admin (owner) can view & track order status 
- in addition to other statistics available via the admin panel.

You can clone this repository and run the website on your localhost. You need to have PHP installed, with MySQL database.
You can download XAMPP, and it will automatically download PHP, MySQL, and Apache server for you.
