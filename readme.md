# Food Ordering & Delivery Management System

I built this project as a requirement for "Software Engineering" (3rd Year university curriculum). 
What I was trying to achieve from this project is to implement a fully functional website using PHP and MySQL database, in order to practice what I have been learning in university curriculums ("Internet Technologies & Web Applications", and "Software Engineering").

## Biref Description of this Project
### Clients can:
- browse the menu, search for specific dishes
- then place an order.
### Restaurant owner (admin) can:
- create e-menu
- insert food items
- classify them in categories.
- view & track order status 
- in addition to other statistics available via the admin panel.



You can clone this repository and run the website on your localhost. You need to have PHP installed, with MySQL database.
You can download XAMPP, and it will automatically download PHP, MySQL, and Apache server for you.
